# HOW TO GET YOUR ACCOUNT UNDISABLED
 
 	MADE BY JANKY AKA 12IRUS AKA 12FLOW 
 
# BACKGROUND INFORMATION
  
	Okay so if you're reading this you probally got your account disabled and wanting to re-enable it. So I am going
	to show you how, before I get into that I want to help you understand that discord may not let you get your account
	back, this is a method that works maybe about 70% of the time, and many people are in that unlucky 30%, the statistics
	vary about the person emailing you, you see discord doesn't have that many admins thats why request to undisable your 
	account take about a day to two days. I have found luck getting re-enabled by maria from discord, but have found to have
	very bad luck from baron from discord. You see it all depends who the person is.
	
# THE EMAIL

	Hi! My name is [insert your name here] and I was going to talk to my friends on the app today when I apeared at
	the login screen, I thought no worries I'll just log in until it says that my account has been disabled, I really
	do not know what I have been disabled for and I am really sorry, you see I love discord and its platmore and I do not
	intend to do anything against the terms of service on purpose, you see whatever I did it was a honest mistake and I am
	sorry for it, if you just tell me what I did I will make sure it will never, and I mean NEVER happen again, thank you 
	in advance.
